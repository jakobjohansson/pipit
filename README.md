# PiPit
A minimal Chrome extension for toggling Picture in Picture.

## Why?
Picture in Picture is already officially supported by Chrome, and can be enabled in the context menu of a video. 

However, a lot of video platforms insert overlays intended for ads above the video element, which makes the context difficult to find without using Chrome DevTools.

This extension provides a button as well as a hotkey `cmd + e` or `ctrl + e` to toggle Picture in Picture with minimal hassle.
